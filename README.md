## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a go at using SCSS - not sure how successfully. Also using pseudo elements to create the hover effects on the image.

### Continued development

More SCSS - maybe next time on a slightly bigger project to see how it can help with structuring the classes and start to use more of the features from it.

- [sass-lang.com/documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - I've only just scratched the surface of this!
